HistoGraph treats multimedia collections as **networks**. The underlying assumption is simple: If two people are mentioned together in a document, we assume, that they may have something to do with each other. Whether or not such a relationship is interesting is in the eye of the beholder.

Co-occurrence networks become huge and unwieldy very quickly, which forces us to filter them based on another simple assumption: The more often entities co-occur, the more likely it is that they have a meaningful relationship with each other. We combine these two assumptions with mathematical models which allow us to rank the list of co-occurrences.

*This tells us who appears with whom and in which documents*.
