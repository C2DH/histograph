##Named Entity Recognition & Disambiguation

HistoGraph combines tools like [YAGO-AIDA](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/databases-and-information-systems/research/yago-naga/aida/) for the automatic detection and disambiguation of *named entities* - people, places, institutions and dates - with crowd-based annotations. Thanks to the enrichment with [DBPedia](http://wiki.dbpedia.org/) and [VIAF](http://viaf.org/) links, histoGraph can handle multilanguage documents flawlessly. By default, every automatically detected entity is pending validation by a human user.

Automatic entity detection works very well overall but will always remain imperfect in places. To address this, HistoGraph depends on human validation and error correction.
