##About
HistoGraph is developed by the CVCE Digital Humanities Lab by Lars Wieneke, Daniele Guido, and Marten DÃ¼ring. HistoGraph builds on a demonstrator application developed for the EC funded collaborative project CUbRIK (Grant agreement number 287704, 2011-14). Further information about the project and the demonstrator can be found on the [website](http://eipcm.org/project/histograph/) of our CUbRIK partner [EIPCM](http://eipcm.org) and the demonstrator itself is accessible on the [site](https://cubrik3.eng.it:8443/SMILA/hoe/index.html) of our colleagues from [ENGINEERING](http://www.eng.it).
To learn more about HistoGraph or to explore demo applications, contact us at histograph@cvce.eu.
