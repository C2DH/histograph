##For developers

HistoGraph is designed as a lightweight browser-based application built on top of a [Neo4j](http://neo4j.com/) graph database and uses [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) and [SigmaJS](http://sigmajs.org/) frameworks.

The code is available on [our github](https://github.com/CVCEeu-dh/histograph) under a [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). 

A [github wiki](https://github.com/CVCEeu-dh/histograph/wiki) is available yet not complete.

Looking forward for your feedback, issues and comments!
