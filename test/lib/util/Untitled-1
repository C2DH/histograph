1/6 NOTES AND NEWS. [Jan.,↵He added that the subject had been fairly fully discussed at the previous↵meeting, but it was arranged that it should come up again that day in consequence↵of the suggestion as to the formation of a Committee, and also because it trenched↵very much on the [Report of the Royal Commission on the Feeble-minded,](RtvaWxnuRr) which↵at that time had not been issued. That Report was now in the hands'of members,↵and he thought it did not greatly modify the views which were arrived at by the↵Association. He asked whether Dr. [Rayner](i-NTP0vtJ3) had any further propositions on the↵subject.↵[Dr. R.WNER](RtvaWxnuRr) said he would formally move the resolution that a Committee be↵appointed, and add that he abided by that proposition. He thought the Com-↵mittee itself should be left to be nominated by the President at leisure.↵The President asked what were to be the terms of reference to the Committee :↵what was it to do ?↵Dr. Ravner replied that the resolution constituted the reference.↵The President said the Committee could not itself apply that mode of treat-↵ment. Was it to suggest means by which it could be applied.↵[Dr. Ravxer.—Yes.](RtvaWxnuRr)↵The President said that before he put the question as to the appointment of a↵Committee he would ask Dr. [Cunyngham Brown](uPMVcQS9y) to reply on the whole discussion↵which took place at the last meeting. No doubt he would be able to give some↵additional arguments in favour of it.↵Dr. [CuNVNGH.\M Brown](RtvaWxnuRr) said he was very glad that his task of replying on the↵discussion would prove a light one, owing to the very kind and friendly way in↵which his paper had been received by the members ; also to the fact that practically↵every speaker who took part in the discussion, with one exception, was entirely in↵favour of the views he advocated with regard to the adoption of family care in↵[England](h9N3iA_ehn) and [Wales.](P5Zg4lpSNi) The general trend of the discussion interested him in that↵every speaker seemed to have in his mind only the segregate or [Scottish](RtvaWxnuRr) system↵of the care of the insane. Only one speaker seemed to take into account the↵advantages of the congregate systems which existed on the Continent. He con-↵sidered, from his own experience and from what he had read, that all the systems↵which had been adopted were good, and in speaking of them he had refrained from↵using qualifying adjectives. Yet he felt that if the family care could come in↵[England](h9N3iA_ehn) and [Wales,](P5Zg4lpSNi) it would be unfortunate if the [Scottish](RtvaWxnuRr) or segregate system↵were employed in the first instance, because it seemed to him that the simplest and↵safest way to bring about family care was by the congregate system, as indicated in the↵resolution. Another thing which interested him very much was, that first Dr.↵[Clouston](aa58IzvFB) said [Wales](P5Zg4lpSNi) would be a good place for the trial of it. Then [Dr. Yellovvlees](RtvaWxnuRr)↵said [South Wales](68x9C8B33) must be excluded, as it was too wealthy. Then Dr. [Robert Jones](JXo3QjQtHK)↵said [North Wales](P5Zg4lpSNi) would not do, as it was too poor. Then it was said that [Ireland](6z9J5Ofxib)↵was too poor. As a matter of fact, there was no country too poor, nor any country↵too wealthy ; no peasantry was. too wretched to have a system of family care. It↵was capable of being applied to private patients as well as to pauper cases. The↵only adverse criticism which was directed towards that system came from Dr. Milsom↵[Rhodes,](zyu3vQi39) whom he did not now see in the room. Dr. [Rhodes](zyu3vQi39) said he thought the↵boarding-out system was good for [Scotland,](RtvaWxnuRr) but it was impossible in [England.](h9N3iA_ehn)↵Such an attitude was beyond his, [Dr. Brown's,](RtvaWxnuRr) comprehension ; because, to be↵logical, what Dr. [Rhodes](zyu3vQi39) ought to have said was, that it m.ight be all very well for↵Scotland, for [Germany,](BXPp7vseCi) for France, for Holland, for Belgium, for [Scandinavia,](RtvaWxnuRr) for↵[Austria- Hungary,](T1jafvO6lb) and the [United States](WdaTp5i9Ma) of [America,](RtvaWxnuRr) but it would not do for↵England. It was difficult to see why [England](h9N3iA_ehn) should be singled out among the↵nations in that way. Those who objected to family care forgot that [Bucknill,](C2YZsPT75) in↵the late fifties, carried it out in the [Devon County Asylum.](RtvaWxnuRr) Dr. Bond, whilst↵sympathising entirely with the movement in favour of the adoption of family care in↵England, addressed some friendly challenges to his, Dr. Brown's, paper ; not so↵much on the contention of his paper, as on the manner in which it was presented.↵He thought he might very well pass those criticisms by, as he did not wish to↵occupy time with any personal defence. The formation of a Committee was a↵proposal of Dr. [Rayner,](i-NTP0vtJ3) but he. Dr. Brown, did not quite see what good it would↵do. If, however, such a Committee were appointed, he would be glad to be of↵what use he could. He had no proposal to make with regard to that Committee.↵The President said that Dr. [Cunyngham Brown](uPMVcQS9y) having replied, the discussion↵
